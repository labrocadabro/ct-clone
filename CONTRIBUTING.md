# Contributor's Guide

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to Community Taught! I am so glad you are here. If you'd like to make a contribution to the project, please follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Find an Issue

If you are looking for an issue to work on, please look through the [issues tab](https://github.com/labrocadabro/communitytaught/issues) and find one that you are interested in. Add a note asking to work on the issue. If you'd like to make a change that isn't related to a current issue, please [create one](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). Explain the change you'd like to make and why.

## Step 2: Wait to be Assigned

Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, please wait for it to be assigned to you. This is to prevent multiple people from working on the same issue, and to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

## Step 3: Fork the Repository

Once you've been assigned an issue, please [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

## Step 3: Create a Branch

Once you've been assigned an issue, please [create a branch](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Git-Branch-Create-Example-Command-Checkout-Commit-Tag) with the issue number and a short description of what you are working on. For example, if you are working on updating the lesson card styling and the issue is #1, you would create a branch called `issue-1-lesson-card-styling`. If you are working on multiple issues, please be careful to create each branch off main. Do not branch off of an issue branch.

## Step 4: Make Changes

Make the necessary changes on your new branch. If you come across additional changes that need to be made, unrelated to the issue you're working on, please do not make those changes on this branch. Instead, create a new issue.

## Step 5: Create a Pull Request

Once you've made the necessary changes, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). In the pull request, please explain what you've changed and why. Especially note any divergences from the original issue, problems you encountered, or anything else that you think is important to note.

Please be sure to [link the pull request to its issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

## Step 6: Make Requested Changes

After you submit your pull request, it will be reviewed. It will either be accepted or changes will be requested. If requested, please make the necessary changes and resubmit your pull request.

## Step 7: Celebrate

Congratulations! You've made your first contribution to Community Taught!
